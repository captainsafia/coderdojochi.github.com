  name: Tony Pawela
  role: Copy Writer
  bio: Writer/Creative Director making ads and other marketing whatnot in the Chicago advertising scene since 2001. I don't develop, program, code or speak the language but I did dabble in BASIC during the 80s. I have two children ages 7 and 8 and I try to expose them to as many different experiences, opportunities, places and ideas as possible. I encourage other parents to do the same for their kids. CoderDojo is a great way to do that.

  role: Marketing
  bio: A marketing professional, certified yoga instructor and entrepreneur who follows the Chicago startup scene. I have no technical skills but absolutely love kids, so much so I produced my own summer kids camp in middle school. Being a creative soul and kid at heart, I'm passionate about building up CoderDojo to provide kids with a creative outlet and to give them the opportunity to learn something they may discover is a true passion. When I'm not working, I'm trying something new (trapeze, improv, woodworking), meeting new people or getting my yoga on.

  name: Jennie Li
  role: Designer
  bio: A visual designer and hobbyist photographer from San Francisco currently living and freezing in the lovely city of Chicago. It was after five years of being a pre-med student that I realized I was meant to be a creative. From a young age I was always playing with art and design in some way - from drawing on the walls with my mom's lipstick to making ghetto websites on Geocities. And while I embrace the interactive world and eat the Internet daily for breakfast, the tactile gratification of print and analog art just can't be replaced by pixels on a screen for me. When not designing, I also enjoy photography, cycling, practicing yoga, listening to music and eating great food with my friends.
