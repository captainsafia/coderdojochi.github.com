  name: Jeff Molsen
  role: Mentor
  bio: Jeff has a Masters in Computer Science from DePaul University concentrating on Foundations of Programming Languages and Artificial Intelligence. He has been working professionally as a programmer since 1994 doing primarily server side Java development on projects which have a web front end for various industries most often as a consultant or contractor. In his freetime he likes to continue learning via books, podcasts, and online classes. For less educational fun, he enjoys video games, sci-fi and fantasy videos, the occasional graphic novel, building with LEGO, and writing about himself in the third person. He enjoys sharing many of those freetime activities with his wife who is also his best friend and roommate. Although he has done some tutoring and mentoring both academically and professionally, he looks forward to sharing his knowledge and understanding to a younger generation eager to be introduced to the world of coding and the new ways of thinking and problem solving that come along with it.
