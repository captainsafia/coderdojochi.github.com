    <h1 class="title">Mission</h1>

    <p>We are here to open doors that are otherwise closed.<br>
    We are here to teach that which is not taught.<br>
    We are here to freely offer our knowledge.<br>
    We welcome all to take it and make it their own.<br>
    We speak the language of the future.<br>
    A language that does not discriminate<br>
    by race, religion, nationality or gender.<br>
    This is our code.<br>
    A creative outlet for self expression.<br>
    A craft for creating the impossible.<br>
    We welcome the curious, adventurous and courageous.<br>
    This is our code.<br>
    And yours.</p>
