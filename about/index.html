    <h1 class="title">About</h1>

    <p>CoderDojoChi is a free computer organization for kids interested in learning how to code. The Chicago Chapter was started by <a href="/mentors/#akarbassi">Ali Karbassi</a> in March 2013; the chapter has grown with the help of many <a href="/volunteer/" title="How to volunteer">volunteers</a> from around the Chicago area.</p>

    <p>The main CoderDojo organization is a not-for-profit organization founded by James Whelton and Bill Liao. It was first started in early 2011 when Whelton hacked the iPod Nano and his younger students expressed an interest in learning how to code. He set up a computer club in his school (PBC Cork) and taught basic HTML and CSS. Later that year he and Bill Liao expanded CoderDojo beyond the after-school computer club.</p>

    <p>A second Dojo was launched soon after in nearby Dublin. The increasing success led to more Dojos in Ireland and around the world that are set up and run entirely by volunteers. Currently, there are nearly 200 Dojos in 24 countries. For a complete list of Dojos and more information on the project, visit <a href="http://www.coderdojo.com">CoderDojo.com</a>.</p>

    <p>We are here to open doors that are otherwise closed.<br>
    We are here to teach that which is not taught.<br>
    We are here to freely offer our knowledge.<br>
    We welcome all to take it and make it their own.<br>
    We speak the language of the future.<br>
    A language that does not discriminate<br>
    by race, religion, nationality or gender.<br>
    This is our code.<br>
    A creative outlet for self expression.<br>
    A craft for creating the impossible.<br>
    We welcome the curious, adventurous and courageous.<br>
    This is our code.<br>
    And yours.</p>
